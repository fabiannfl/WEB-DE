        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>
          <strong>Since I was a small child I have been 
            interested in how the things that took 
            apart all my toys worked, what I like 
            the most is learning by doing, in fact,                        
            if I don't understand the context I hardly 
            assimilate it, I have been experimenting 
            with tools and materials. Learn to use and 
            implement them. Now, that's all I've been 
            doing: making things and teaching how to 
            make things with metal, wood, plastic, and 
            more.I've been making stuff since I could 
            hold a hammer or screwdriver and probably longer than that. 
            I grew up with my mother, who offered me the 
            freedom to experiment and explore. She put 
            me in an environment to continue experimenting 
            and learning, so my education, which has been 
            mostly self-taught, involved a wide range of 
            problem solving for this reason I like the difficult 
            using all kinds of tools, skills and materials ... 
            and that is my philosophy in the workshop; learn as
             much as you can about anything and everything so that
              it becomes part of your problem solving arsenal the 
              root of creativity and necessity is the mother of 
              all inventions</strong>
